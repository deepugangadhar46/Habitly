## 🚨 ACTION REQUIRED (DO NOW)

### 1. Generate PWA Icons ⚡ (5 minutes)

**WHY:** PWA won't install on phones without proper PNG icons.

**HOW:**
1. Open `generate-icons.html` in Chrome/Edge
2. Two canvases auto-generate (192x192 and 512x512)
3. Click "Download 192x192" → Save to `public/icon-192.png`
4. Click "Download 512x512" → Save to `public/icon-512.png`
5. Done! Icons are ready.

**After saving:**
```bash
git add public/icon-*.png
git commit -m "Add PWA icons"
```

### 2. Test Locally (2 minutes)

```bash
npm run preview
```

Visit `http://localhost:4173` and test:
- [x] Create habit → Works?
- [x] Complete habit → Undo toast appears?
- [x] Search habits → Filters correctly?
- [x] Complete with 😔 mood → Nudge notification?
- [x] Go offline (DevTools) → Still works?

### 3. Deploy to Vercel (3 minutes)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow prompts (login, confirm)
```

**Or use Netlify:**
```bash
npm i -g netlify-cli
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod
```

## 🛡️ IF JUDGES ASK...

**"Why no backend?"**
> "Privacy-first design. Your data never leaves your device. Plus it's faster - no API delays!"

**"What if I switch devices?"**
> "Export/import works today. We can add Firebase sync in Phase 2."

**"How does undo work?"**
> "We store previous state for 3 seconds in a React ref. Click undo = restore state. After timeout = commit permanently."

**"What's the hardest part?"**
> "The emotional intelligence system - mapping moods to appropriate responses and timing notifications perfectly."
