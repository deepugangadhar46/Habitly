## üìã What to Do Right Now

### Step 1: Read the Key Papers (30 minutes)
**MOST IMPORTANT PAPER:**
- **Digital Behavior Change Intervention Designs for Habit Formation** (Wang et al., 2024)
- Link: https://www.jmir.org/2024/1/e54375
- Read at least the **Abstract** and **Discussion** sections
- This paper is PERFECT for your project - it's about habit formation in digital apps!

**SECOND MOST IMPORTANT:**
- **Using Health and Well-Being Apps for Behavior Change** (McKay et al., 2019)
- Link: https://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/7/e11926/
- Shows gaps in existing apps (which Habitly fixes!)

### Step 2: Understand Your Unique Angle (15 minutes)
**What makes Habitly special?**
- ‚úÖ PWA (works on any device, no app store needed)
- ‚úÖ Offline-first (works without internet)
- ‚úÖ Open source and free
- ‚úÖ Complete data ownership
- ‚úÖ Modern tech stack (React, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive gamification (not just one feature)
- ‚úÖ Advanced analytics with charts

**Your pitch:** "Most habit apps only implement 1-3 behavior change techniques. Habitly implements 9+ research-backed techniques in a modern PWA."

### Step 3: Fill in the Template (2-3 hours)

**Essential sections to customize:**
1. **Abstract** - Summarize your entire paper in 200 words
2. **Introduction** - Explain why Habitly is needed
3. **Implementation Challenges** - Add any problems you faced
4. **Screenshots** - Add actual screenshots of your app
5. **Team Contributions** - Who did what

**You can mostly keep as-is:**
- Literature Review (already written!)
- Feature descriptions (matches your actual code)
- Technology stack (accurate for your project)
- References (already formatted)

## üí° Tips for Your Presentation

### When Judges Ask: "What's new in your project?"

**Good Answer:**
> "We analyzed systematic reviews of 344+ habit tracking apps and found most only implement 2-3 behavior change techniques. Habitly integrates 9 research-backed techniques including self-monitoring, goal setting, contextual prompts, positive reinforcement, and social challenges. Additionally, we built it as a PWA for universal access and offline functionality‚Äîsomething missing in most existing apps."

**Support with:** Show Table 2 from the paper (addressing research gaps)

### When Judges Ask: "What are the technical highlights?"

**Good Answer:**
> "We implemented a Progressive Web App using React 18 and TypeScript with offline-first architecture. All data is stored in IndexedDB for privacy and offline access. The app can be installed on any device without app stores, works completely offline, and has a Lighthouse PWA score of 95+. We also implemented service workers for push notifications and data caching."

**Support with:** Show the app working offline, demonstrate installation

### When Judges Ask: "What research did you base this on?"

**Good Answer:**
> "Our design is grounded in a 2024 systematic review of digital behavior change interventions by Wang et al., which identified self-monitoring, goal setting, and prompts as the most effective techniques. We also referenced McKay et al.'s analysis of 344 behavior change apps, which found significant gaps in feature comprehensiveness. Every feature in Habitly maps to a research-backed behavior change technique."

**Support with:** Show Table 1 (Feature-Technique Mapping)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
1. **Copy-paste directly from the papers** - That's plagiarism!
2. **Cite papers you haven't read** - Judges might ask details
3. **Claim to have tested effectiveness** - You didn't do a user study
4. **Overstate capabilities** - Be honest about limitations

### ‚úÖ DO:
1. **Paraphrase properly** - Rewrite in your own words
2. **Cite everything** - When in doubt, add a citation
3. **Be honest about limitations** - Shows maturity
4. **Focus on design and implementation** - That's what you actually did
5. **Emphasize learning** - You learned React, PWA, TypeScript, etc.
